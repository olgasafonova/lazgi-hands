# Lazgi Hands - Research & Concept

## Project Vision

An interactive web experience that teaches Khorezm Lazgi hand movements through:
- Real-time hand tracking via webcam
- Template overlays showing target positions
- Visual particle effects responding to movement
- Generative music responding to gestures
- Uzbek Ikat-inspired visual aesthetics

**The poetic connection**: Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850 CE) was born in Khorezm. His Latinized name gave us "algorithm." This project uses algorithms to visualize dance from his homeland.

## Lazgi Movement Vocabulary

### Movement Progression (Key Insight)

Lazgi follows a distinctive sequential awakening pattern:

1. **Static pose** - Arm raised, directed toward the Sun
2. **Fingers** - First to move, trembling
3. **Wrists** - Trembling motion (the word "lazgi" means "tremble")
4. **Arms/Elbows** - Join the movement
5. **Shoulders** - Sliding and shaking
6. **Neck** - Sliding movements
7. **Torso** - Engages fully
8. **Legs** - Complete body involvement

This progression mimics fire igniting; the dance carries Zoroastrian fire-worship symbolism.

### Technical Hand Characteristics

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wrist trembling** | Rapid, continuous vibration; looks like flame or sunshine rays |
| **Finger flutter** | Independent finger movements, continuous trembling |
| **"Broken" style** | Characteristic of Khorezm; angular, bent-joint aesthetic |
| **Shoulder slides** | Neck and shoulder sliding movements |
| **Palm orientation** | Often directed upward toward the Sun |

### Gender Distinctions

- **Women's Lazgi**: More virtuosic, scintillant hand/shoulder movements
- **Both genders**: Finger snapping, arm shakes, lofty stance

### Key Positions to Track (Template Candidates)

1. **Sun salutation** - Arms raised, palms up, fingers spread
2. **Trembling flame** - Wrists vibrating, fingers fluttering
3. **Broken angles** - Bent wrists, angular finger positions
4. **Shoulder slide prep** - Hands at shoulder height, ready to slide
5. **Finger snap position** - Thumb to middle finger contact

## Visual Style: Uzbek Ikat Patterns

### Ikat Technique ("Abrband")

The word means "tying a cloud" in Persian. Threads are dyed before weaving, creating the characteristic blurred edges.

### Fabric Types

| Type | Composition | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Atlas** | Pure silk | Glossy, satin weave, bold colors, festive wear |
| **Adras** | 50% silk, 50% cotton | Durable, everyday use, floral patterns |
| **Beqasam** | Mixed | Traditional chapans (coats) |

### Pattern Motifs (for particle/trail effects)

| Pattern Name | Meaning | Visual |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Tumorcha** | Amulet | Small protective shape |
| **Bodom** | Almond | Paisley-like curves |
| **Anor** | Pomegranate | Circular with internal seeds |
| **Oy** | Moon | Crescent shapes |
| **Shokh** | Horn | Curved, spiral |
| **Chirog** | Lamp | Flame shape |
| **Ilon izi** | Snake trail | Wavy lines |
| **Kapalak** | Butterfly | Symmetrical wings |
| **Chayon** | Scorpion | Sharp angular points |

### Color Palette (Traditional Ikat)

```css
:root {
  --ikat-indigo: #1a237e;
  --ikat-crimson: #b71c1c;
  --ikat-gold: #ffc107;
  --ikat-turquoise: #00838f;
  --ikat-cream: #fff8e1;
  --ikat-purple: #6a1b9a;
  --ikat-green: #2e7d32;
}

## Al-Khwarizmi Connection

### Historical Context

Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850 CE):
- Born in Khwarezm (modern Uzbekistan/Turkmenistan border)
- Worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad
- Wrote "Kitab al-Jabr wa al-Muqabala" (origin of "algebra")
- His Latinized name "Algoritmi" became "algorithm"
- Introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to the Islamic world

### The Silk Road Connection

Khorezm sat on the Silk Road, a cultural crossroads where:
- Zoroastrian fire worship influenced dance (sun/flame symbolism)
- Trade brought textiles, patterns, and cultural exchange
- Mathematical and astronomical knowledge flowed through

### Project Symbolism

The code tracking hands uses algorithms named after a man from Khorezm, visualizing the dance of his homeland. The patterns drawn by particle effects echo Ikat textiles that traveled the same Silk Roads.

- Initial raised-arm sun position
- Wrist trembling at various angles
- "Broken" angular finger positions
- Transition poses between movements
